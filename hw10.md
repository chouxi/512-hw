### 9.1

Assume that there are no more than n clauses and 2SAT can get a solution in T(n). If there is a 2SAT problem which has n + 1 clauses, the previous clause plus a clause which is $(a \bigcup b)$.

Then we start from a as false, this clause is true when b is true. So this clause is solved, remaining 2SAT problem has n cluases same as the assumption.

The remaing 2SAT with n clauses can be solved in T(n), and then combine with the previous a=false,b=true part. If the reaming clauses is not satisfied, the problem is not satisfied.

We expand the remaing 2SAT with n clauses like the first one, no matter it satisfied or not, it will stop or return in linear time. If it's not satisfied, we return to first and change a to true.

And repeated the process.

So the time is a = true plus expand all with  a = false plus expand all, which is O(n).

Obviously we can get a recursion function.

T(n) = O(n) + T(n-1) Which is in polynomial time.
