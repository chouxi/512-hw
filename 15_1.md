Since directed acyclic graphs can be linearized, we can sort it in topological order. And then the problem can be solved by Dynamic Programming.
LongestPath (G)
- Input: weight Dag
- Output: Largest Path Cost
Topologically sort G
For each vertex $v\in V$ in linearized order
$\quad$ do dist($v$) = $max_{(u,v)\in E}${$dist(u)+weight(u,v)$} 
return $max_{v\in V}${$dist(v)$}

The above algorithm describes the subproblems as: The largest path cost from s to v is the maximum of the predecessor $u$'s longest path cost plus the step cost from $u $ to $v$. Topologically sorting the graph takes $O(V+E)$ time. Then the algorithm updates each vertice's longest path cost by running a loop on all of the adjacent vertices. And there are $O(E)$ number of vertices in the graph. So the inner loop is executed $O(V+E)$ times. Therefore, the complexity of the algorithm is $O(V+E)$;
